## Why dbt? 

dbt (data build tool) is an open-source command-line tool to orchestrate data transforms using SQL. It helps to bring software engineering best practices, such as modularity, version control, and testing, to data transformation workflows. 
By doing so, it helps to create reliable, maintainable, and well-documented data assets using ELT paradigm.

Here are a set of assumptions that make dbt a valueble tool in Lakehouse project:

- Assumption 1: Need SDLC for managing development of KPI/metrics 
   - Ensures all logic is repeatable and written as code and commited to a repository with proper documention
   - Provides a framework to systematically design, develop, test and create KPI/data assets
   - Provides oppertunity for an independent team should be able to validate and certify the accuracy
   - Ensures that there is proper business continuity and there are no knowledge silos or key man risks in the process 
- Assumption 2: Need continious testing/validation for KPI/metrics development pipelines
   - Unlike pure software development, the code/logic for KPIs is dependent on the state of the data
   - This creates need for continious testing and validation of assumptions
- Assumption 3: Expect varying degree of complexity to metrics generation
   - Simple sql query to complex pipelines
   - Complex ones need a more methodical way to debug and analyze the code  
- Assumption 4: KPI/metrics creation owned by analysts and not data engineers
- Assumption 5: For many data analysts/scientists/report builders and even sql programmers,
  software engineering background tends to be optional
   - The analysts/report builders unlike engineers end up writing/running queries on console window.
   - Testing, as such is optional, and repeated testing is extremely rare.

Pros and Cons of dbt
- Pros
  - SQL programming, unlike imperative languages like python or java is not modular and function oriented, 
   so it is not easy to decompose and test it as independent modules without lot of creative scaffolding. 
  - dbt provides an effective way to address this problem. Not just that, it is the solution leader in this space. 
- Cons
   - dbt doesnot support transformation outside SQL. Modern data engineering has outgrown using just SQL for ETL transformation.
   - Data engineering outside sql creates more scope for automation and reusability and can handle batch/realtime data flows
   - dbt is not useful for data movement. Example: data Ingestion (extraction, loading) or reverse ETL for publishing
   - Cross platform transformation is not easy. dbt doesnot provide its own compute and works best on single compute platform. 
   - Due to its limited scope, providing enterprise wide end to end data lineage purely using dbt documentation is difficult
   - Hard to integrate if we bring in 3rd party data quality management tools

#### Why dbt cloud over dbt core ?
dbt cloud offers the following features over dbt core layer (which is open sourced). Most features are aimed at ease of use, automation and collaboration, making it easy for untrained analyst with little knowledge of sdlc processes or without skills to set up the necessary software tooling required for the SDLC workflow steps to engage with and work in that framework without big learning curve.  

dbt cloud offers the following:

*   **Web-Based IDE**
     - Provides a built-in, browser-based IDE for developing, testing, version-controlling, and deploying dbt projects.
     - With dbt core, it requires users setting up their local IDEs with proper plugins and/or cli support.
*   **Job Scheduling and Orchestration**
     - Can use UI for scheduling and orchestrating dbt runs.
     - Easy configuring of run parameters, frequencies, job dependencies, timeouts, and retry logic.
     - With dbt Core, you must integrate and manage with Airflow, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI or yaml configuration files for scheduling.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration**
     - Offers access management, code review, approval, and version-controlled environments.
     - With dbt Core, we have to setup dev/staging/prod environments and the approval and code promotion process.
     - We have to use git based commands and requires knowledge of git and our code branching strategies.  
*   **Built-in CI/CD**
     - Offers built-in CI/CD features that automatically trigger on code checkin.
     - This can trigger actions like running tests, deploying to production, generating documention, creating reports etc
     - For dbt Core, implementing CI/CD requires integration with third-party tools.
     - However, his is foundational need and we intend to do this via airflow.  
*   **Monitoring and Alerting**
     - Provides integrated monitoring and alerting.
     - With dbt Core, we will need to inspect airflow logs.
*   **Automatic Documentation and Data Lineage**
     - Automatically generates documentation for data models and tracks data lineage.
     - With dbt core, provides tools to do this for own use, but hosting will need to be managed as DIY solution 
*   **Semantic Layer**
     - Provides a governed, API-driven gateway to access your metrics. 
     - Helps in standardizing business metrics and enforcing consistent definitions across an organization.
     - Simplifies access for business users, and streamlines metric management 
     - Decouples the metric definition from the specific querying tools.
     
Also as a managed offering with enterprise support it includes following benefits:

*   **Managed Infrastructure and Reduced Operational Overhead**
     - dbt Cloud is a fully managed service, handling set up, hosting, or maintaining the infrastructure required.
     - With dbt Core, you are responsible for managing your own infrastructure, which can involve significant time and effort.
*   **Dedicated Support**
     - Access to a dedicated support team, a service not available with the open-source dbt Core.

To conclude, dbt core provides all the core functionality needed for SDLC compliant SQL development. Using dbt core provides 
ability for a class of users like data analysts, report creators and/or developers with SQL programming skills to engage with 
the setup with minimal training and support

## What is in dbt Semantic Layer (only in dbt cloud)?

The proprietary Semantic Layer extends beyond dbt's core transformation capabilities. It standardizes and centralizes 
the definition of business metrics, ensuring consistency and accuracy across an organization's various analytical tools 
and applications.

1.  **Centralized Metric Definitions:**
   - Define key business metrics (e.g., "Monthly Recurring Revenue," "Active Users," "Conversion Rate") directly in dbt, alongside their data models, using a dedicated configuration. This ensures that every team and tool querying these metrics uses the exact same logic and definition.
   - This eliminates the "metric sprawl" problem, where different reports or dashboards might show conflicting numbers due to slight variations in SQL queries for the same business concept.

3.  **Headless BI / Metric Store:**
    -   It acts as a "headless BI" layer or a "metric store." Instead of directly querying the underlying tables and views in the data warehouse, analytical tools query the Semantic Layer.
    -   This means business users can ask for "Active Users" without needing to know the complex SQL logic, join conditions, or specific tables involved in calculating that metric.

4.  **Consistent Queries for Downstream Tools:**
    - Provides an API endpoint (GraphQL API) that can be integrated with various downstream tools such as:
        -   **Business Intelligence (BI) tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Mode, Metabase.
        -   **Data Science notebooks:** Jupyter, RStudio.
        -   **Spreadsheets:** Excel, Google Sheets.
        -   **Custom applications:** Internal dashboards, embedded analytics.
    - When these tools query the Semantic Layer, it dynamically generates the correct SQL to fetch the metric data from the underlying data warehouse, applying filters, aggregations, and dimensions as requested, always based on the single source of truth definition.

5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - The Semantic Layer can intelligently optimize queries, leveraging pre-aggregated data (if available in dbt models) or pushing down aggregations to the data warehouse for efficiency.

6.  **Access Control and Governance:**
    -   It offers a layer for managing access control to metrics, ensuring that users only see the data they are authorized to access, independent of direct data warehouse permissions.

### Is it Available in dbt Core?

** No, the complete dbt Cloud Semantic Layer as a managed service with its API and integrations is not directly available in dbt Core.**

However, dbt Labs has made efforts to bring parts of this functionality to the open-source community:

-   **dbt-metricflow (Open Source):** dbt Labs has open-sourced `dbt-metricflow`, which is the core engine that powers the metric definitions within dbt Cloud's Semantic Layer. This allows dbt Core users to define metrics within their dbt projects using a `metrics.yml` file, similar to how they define models and sources.
-   **Limitations of dbt-metricflow (Open Source) Alone:** While `dbt-metricflow` allows you to *define* metrics, it **does not** provide the hosted API, performance optimizations, or direct integrations with external BI tools that are part of the managed dbt Cloud Semantic Layer. You would need to build custom integrations or use other open-source "headless BI" tools (like Cube.dev) on top of your dbt project (and potentially `dbt-metricflow`) to achieve similar querying capabilities and broad tool compatibility.

In essence, dbt Core users can define metrics, but they would need to build or integrate separate solutions to expose those metrics consistently to downstream applications via an API, which is what the proprietary dbt Cloud Semantic Layer provides out-of-the-box as a managed service.
